Benny loved to play all \\nday long, and he often forgot to take a nap. \\nOne evening, Benny\\'s mom said, \"It\\'s time for bed, Benny. You need to get some rest.\" \\nBenny didn\\'t want to go to bed because he was having too much fun playing. But then, his mom \\ntold him a secret: \"If you go to bed early, you\\'ll wake up feeling refreshed and energized, and \\nyou\\'ll have even more fun tomorrow!\" \\nBenny thought about it for a moment, and he realized his mom was right. So he snuggled up in \\nhis cozy bed, closed his eyes, and soon drifted off to sleep. \\nThe next morning, Benny woke up feeling amazing! He had so much energy that he played all \\nday long, and he didn\\'t feel tired at all. \\nFrom then on, Benny went to bed early every night, and he always woke up feeling refreshed and \\nready for another day of adventure. The end. '"
